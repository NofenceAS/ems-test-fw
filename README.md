# x3-fw-app

The X3  nRF52840 firmware, using Nordic Connect SDK and Zephyr RTOS.


## Getting started

*Note*: Although Nordic Connect SDK is available for Windows and Mac, we
strongly recommend to use Linux Ubuntu 20.1 for development. Some of the features in
the build system will not be available on windows (mainly due to POSIX compliance)

1. Install the Nordic Connect SDK manually as described in https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/gs_installing.html
   In particular, install west and the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain
